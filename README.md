## basic bitch asurascans (and mangapill) rss
runs every hour or so

if u see the repo being not autoupdated, then there are probably no new chapters. it doesn't do baseless commits.

**recommended** to run it on ur own server with cronjobs

future plans (wont happen):
- add more sites
- integrate into a single script
- better docs

ok bye
